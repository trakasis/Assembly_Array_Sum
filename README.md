# Assembly_Array_Sum
An assignment from my Assembly class where I had to sum all the positive elements of an array and to alter any registers appropriately.


As per assignment instructions:

declare an array of 5 signed integer values in hexadecimal form

store resulting sum of positive numbers in EBX register

store number of positive elements in EDX register
